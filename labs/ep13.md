# Security+ Lab â€“ Episode 13: Nmap

This lab focused on using **Nmap** to scan hosts, identify open ports, and detect services.  

---

## Exercises Performed
- Basic host scan: `nmap scanme.org`  
- Specific port scan (SSH): `nmap scanme.org -p 22`  
- TCP scan across top 1000 ports: `nmap scanme.org -p 1-1000`  
- UDP scan: `nmap 172.16.1.1 -sU`  
- Service and version detection: `nmap scanme.org -sV`  
- Output results to file: `nmap scanme.org -oN results.txt`  
- Ping scan for live hosts: `nmap scanme.org -sn`  
- Tested Nmap scripting engine (NSE): `nmap scanme.org --script=http,banner`  

---

## Key Takeaways
- Nmap provides visibility into what services are exposed  
- Service/version detection helps confirm patch levels  
- Saving results creates useful records for incident response  
- Must always use Nmap responsibly with permission

## Next Steps
- Continue with advanced Nmap scripting examples  
- Move on to Episode 14 (Scanless) for stealth scanning
