# Security+ Labs – Episodes 1 to 12

This document covers my work from Episode 1 to Episode 12 in the Security+ hands-on lab series.  

---

## Environment
- VirtualBox for virtualization  
- Kali Linux and Ubuntu as lab systems  
- pfSense as firewall and router  

---

## Covered Topics

### Basic Setup
- Installed VirtualBox  
- Set up Kali Linux and Ubuntu  
- Created a firewall with pfSense  

### Network Tools
- **ping** – tested connectivity between systems  
- **traceroute** – identified the path of network traffic  
- **ifconfig, route, arp** – checked local network settings  
- **hping3** – tested packet behavior  
- **Netcat** – debugged and tested connections  

---

## Key Lessons
- A virtual lab is a safe way to practice without risking a real system  
- Simple commands like ping and traceroute give valuable insights into network health  
- Firewall rules must be in the correct order to work properly  
- Netcat is flexible for checking how devices talk to each other

## Next Steps
- Add more Linux tools (grep, cat, logger)  
- Explore packet analysis with tcpdump and Wireshark  
- Continue documenting progress
