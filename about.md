# About This Project

This project is my journey of building a Security+ home lab.  
It serves two purposes:  
1. To strengthen my technical skills with hands-on practice.  
2. To document my progress in a clear and structured way.

## Why I’m Sharing This
By documenting and publishing my work, I:  
- Build discipline to stay consistent.  
- Create a portfolio that reflects real practice.  
- Share knowledge with others starting their own labs.
