Each report follows a structured format, including:  

- **Overview** – Lab title, date, and objective  
- **Environment** – Tools and systems used  
- **Steps Taken** – Actions performed with screenshots where needed  
- **Observations** – Results, challenges, and fixes  
- **Key Takeaways** – What was learned and why it matters  
- **Next Steps** – Planned improvements or follow-ups

## Purpose
These reports are written in a professional format, similar to what’s used in real-world security operations and incident response.  
They serve as both practice and portfolio evidence of my skills.
